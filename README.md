# EDA_House_Prices

In this repository we will do a Exploratory Data Analysis in the King County House Prices dataset to help a client who is in the real state business. He wants to expand his business to Seatle and he uses a very popular web search engine. He has asked us to analize the data to improve his approach when looking for new opportunities.

He is specially interested in proving these points:

    1. Renovated houses are more expensive than not renovated ones.
    2. One extra bedroom increases the price more than one extra bathroom.
    3. The biggest lots are situated far from the city center.
    
The analysis was done in a [Jupyter Notebook ](https://github.com/PerezCorrea/EDA_House_Prices/blob/7880b8f7b7e23351e5b89ad8a2b4f3329fc280c1/EDA_Housing_prices.ipynband) the most important results were shown in the [slides](https://github.com/PerezCorrea/EDA_House_Prices/blob/7880b8f7b7e23351e5b89ad8a2b4f3329fc280c1/CK_House_Prices.pdf).
